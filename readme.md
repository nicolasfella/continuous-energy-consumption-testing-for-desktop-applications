This repository contains extra resources for my Master Thesis "Continuous Energy Consumption Testing for Desktop Applications"

These are:
 - The shell scripts used to automate usage scenarios
 - The input data files used for the experiments
 - The code changes applied to KParts and Okular
 - The code used to generate "empty" test suites
